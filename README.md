# 💻Coding
### Hi, I am Mahmoud Ahmed 👋, I have been working as software engineer since 2005/2006.
### A personal repository to `practice and reinforce fundamental programming concepts` 🚀 across multiple programming languages basics.

### Here I am trying to build strong 🧠 technical skills, flexible understanding of `programming skills`, `design skills` including `data structures` and `algorithms` for multiple subjects starting from low to high level languages, also applying practical codes for my daily self-study for schedule subjects or courses lessons.

### Mostly like separated small 🛠️ projects for multiple `courses`, `problem solving` challenges for multiple online programming platforms, contains folders as a playground for different `programming libraries` or `frameworks`.

C#, .NET, ASP.NET MVC CORE, REST API, Entity Framework, Dependency Injection, Repository Design Pattern.\
JavaScript, TypeScript.\
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS.\
Angular, React.\
Nodejs, Express.\
Relational DB: MS SQL SERVER, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.\
Python.\
JAVA.\
GO.\
Game Development: Unity.\
And More.. 🌊

### Also, I am preparing other repositories for complete sample projects 🏗️ including Front-End and Back-End implementation.
