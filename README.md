# Coding
Different practical programming languages and applying codes for my daily self study schedule subjects.
It mostly like separated small projects for multiple courses or problem solutions or challenges for multiple online programming platform.
Here I am trying to level up my programming/design skills for multiple subjects starting from low to high level languages.
The current repository contains folders as playground for different programming libraries or framworks.
Also I am preparing another repositories for complete sample projects including Front-End and Back-End implementation
