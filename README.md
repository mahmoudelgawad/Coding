# Coding
Here my practical multiple programming languages. trying to apply practical codes for my daily self study schedule subjects or courses lessons.
It is mostly like separated small projects for multiple courses, problem solving or challenges for multiple online programming platforms.
Here I am trying to level up my programming/design skills for multiple subjects starting from low to high level languages.
The current repository contains folders as a playground for different programming libraries or frameworks.
Also I am preparing another repositories for complete sample projects including Front-End and Back-End implementation
