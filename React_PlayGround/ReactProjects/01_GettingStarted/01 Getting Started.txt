	The vite npm package refers to Vite, 
	a next-generation frontend build tool designed to significantly improve the frontend development experience.
	It is available on the npm registry,
	allowing developers to easily install and integrate it into their projects using the Node Package Manager (npm).

	In essence, installing the vite npm package provides access to this powerful tooling,
	enabling developers to scaffold new projects, run a fast development server,
	and build optimized production bundles for their frontend applications.
