//#Components using (JSX, props, state), natively use combine of (html, js , css)
//  #most use component or small blocks as resuable blocks like 'button' or header
//  #each component represent different concepts

//#to start your app run development server
>npm run dev

//#component function name must be PascalCase "Header' or "MyHeader"
//#use 'format document' to handle the complex jsx with html source code for current page 

//# in css 'rem' unit The core difference is that px (pixels) is an absolute, fixed unit, while rem (root em) is a relative, scalable unit based on the root HTML font size

//# in react even if you split css for specific component will affect on all pages not scoped for current component only
    so you need advanced solution for scoped css affect.
